## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added \value in the documentation of the functions.

* Wrapped documentation examples in \donttest if execution > 5s on at least one of tested environments (plot_polar_smooths(), plot_polar_smooths(), polar_gam()).

## Test environments
- R-hub windows-x86_64-devel (r-devel)
- R-hub ubuntu-gcc-release (r-release)
- R-hub fedora-clang-devel (r-devel)

## R CMD check results
> On windows-x86_64-devel (r-devel), ubuntu-gcc-release (r-release), fedora-clang-devel (r-devel)

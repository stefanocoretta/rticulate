# Installation

**IMPORTANT**: The package `tidymv` needs to be [installed](https://github.com/stefanocoretta/tidymv) first.

To install the package, run `devtools::install_github("stefanocoretta/rticulate@v1.3.4", build_vignettes = TRUE)`.
To learn the basic use of the package, run `vignette("tongue-imaging", package = "rticulate")` after the installation.

If you want to try the development version, run `devtools::install_github("stefanocoretta/rticulate", build_vignettes = TRUE)` instead.

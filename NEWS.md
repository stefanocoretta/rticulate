# rticulate v2.0.1

## Changed

* `read_aaa()` has a `knot` and `fan_lines` argument for users to specify the number of DLC knots or fan-lines depending on whether they are reading DLC or legacy fan-line data with no header.

* The vignette `tongue-imaging` has been updated to show how to read DLC and EMA data.



# rticulate v2.0.0

## BREAKING

* `read_aaa()` now can read AAA data with existing headers, both fan-line and DeepLabCut data.

  * Now any column starting with `X` or `Y` will be selected for pivoting when `format = "long"` (the default).

* This enhancement has brought in a few breaking changes:

  * The order of the arguments has changed.
  * The argument `fan_line` doesn't have a default any more, so it has to be specified.
  
* `plot_polar_smooths()` has been deprecated due to removal of tidymv and it now does not do anything. An alternative will soon be added. For the time being, you can extract predictions with `tidygam::predict_gam()` and convert to Cartesian coordinates manually.

## Added

* `read_ag500_pos()` to read `.pos` files from Carstens AG500 electro-magnetic-articulographer.

* `filter_signal()` to filter a signal with a Savitzky-Golay or Butterworth filter.

* `resample_signal()` to up/down-sample a signal using interpolation.

* `get_velocity()` and `get_acceleration()` to calculate the velocity and acceleration (first and second derivative) of displacement.

* `get_landmarks()` to get several gestural landmarks from the displacement of a single gesture.

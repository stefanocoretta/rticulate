This is the repository of the R package `rticulate`. This package provides two functions for importing UTI data from Articulate Assistant Advanced and plotting UTI data from any source.

## Installation

The package is on CRAN, so you can install it from there with `install.packages("rticulate")`.

If you like living on edge, install a polished pre-release with:

```{r install-pre, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github(
  "stefanocoretta/rticulate",
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)
```

Or the development version with:

```{r install-dev, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github(
  "stefanocoretta/rticulate@devel",
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)
```

## Usage

To learn the basic use of the package, run `vignette("tongue-imaging", package = "rticulate")` after the installation.

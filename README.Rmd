This is the repository of the R package `rticulate`. This package provides two functions for importing UTI data from Articulate Assistant Advancedâ„¢ (both Deep Lab Cut and legacy fan-line spline data) and electro-magnetic articulographic data from a Carstens AG500.

## Installation

The package is on CRAN, so you can install it from there with `install.packages("rticulate")`.

If you like living on edge, install a polished pre-release with:

```{r install-pre, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github(
  "stefanocoretta/rticulate",
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)
```

Or the development version with:

```{r install-dev, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github(
  "stefanocoretta/rticulate@devel",
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)
```

## Usage

For an overview of the package functionalities covered in the vignettes, run `vignette("overview", package = "rticulate")` after the installation.

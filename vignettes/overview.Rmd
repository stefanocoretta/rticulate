rticulate offers a few helper functions to work with ultrasound tongue imaging data, exported from Articulate Assistant Advancedâ„¢ or other systems.

The following vignettes give details on specific topics:

- `vignette("tongue-imaging", package = "rticulate")`: You should start here to learn how to import UTI data and plot tongue contours.
- `vignette("polar-gams", package = "rticulate")`: This vignette describes the function `polar_gam()` which can be used to model tongue contours with GAMs using polar coordinates.
- `vignette("transform-coord", package = "rticulate")`: In most cases, you won't need to convert to polar coordinates explicitly, but in case you want to do that, you can look at this vignette to learn how to use `transform_coord()`.

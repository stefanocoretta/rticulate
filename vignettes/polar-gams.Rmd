# Read data

The package `rticulate` comes with a dataset containg spline data from two speakers of Italian.

```{r load-data}
library(rticulate)
data(tongue)
tongue
```

# Fit a polar GAM

The spline data is in cartesian coordinates. The function `polar_gam()` converts the coordinates to polar and fits a GAM to the data.
The polar coordinates are calculated based on the origin of the probe, which is estimated if `origin = NULL` using the fan lines specified with the argument `fan_lines` (the defaults are `c(10, 25)`).

If you get an error relating to `lm.fit`, try to change the `fan_lines` to values different from the default.

```{r polar-place}
tongue_it01 <- filter(tongue, speaker == "it01")

polar_place <- polar_gam(
    Y ~
        s(X, by = c2_place) +
        s(X, word, bs = "fs"),
    data = tongue_it01
)
summary(polar_place)
```

The output model is in polar coordinates but it contains the origin coordinates so that plotting can be done in cartesian coordinates.

We can now plot the results from the model with `plot_polar_smooths()`.

```{r plot-smooths}
plot_polar_smooths(
    polar_place,
    X,
    c2_place
) +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
```
